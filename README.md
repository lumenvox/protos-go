# LumenVox API Go Stubs

This repository provides precompiled Go stubs for gRPC-based communication with the
LumenVox API. We provide precompiled Go stubs because Go's tooling allows importing
them directly from Git with versioning, which other languages don't support natively.
For other languages, please generate stubs using the standard protobuf compiler.
